# DeepLearning
Programs written while working through http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/deeplearning.pdf 

Original source code for book and data sources are here https://github.com/lisa-lab/DeepLearningTutorials.git

Theano documentation is here: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/#documentation



This is a place to store the code I write while working through "Deep Learning Tutorial"

My code is in Python 3, book and sample code is Python 2. Not sure which version of Theano he's using, I'm on 0.7/0.8, some minor changes were needed to get his code working running.

I'm also trying to keep each example net self contained instead of broken into separate files like book examples. This is so I can easily drop a network with only the parts I need into a new project. Once that's done it'll be easy to put the various classes back into separate files.

*doing a quick brush up on Theano and updating some of these examples with cleaner code


<strike>Logistic Regression</strike> ( updated )

<strike>Multilayer Perceptron</strike> ( updated )

<strike>Basic Convolutional Network to filter images</strike> ( updated )

<strike>LeNet5</strike>  ( updated, hoping to add QLearning to this to make a deep reinforcement net ) 

<strike>Denoising Autoencoders</strike> ( updated )

<strike>Stacked Denoising Autoencoders</strike> ( minor changes and testing )

<strike>Restricted Boltzmann Machine</strike> ( no changes )

<strike>Deep Belief Network</strike> ( very minor changes )

<strike>Hybrid Monte-Carlo Sampling</strike> ( no update )

<strike>Elman-Recurrent</strike> (Python 2.x-3.x and replaced PERL script with slow but working Python)
                ( clean up code, fix a few bugs )


<strike>LSTM for Sentiment Analysis</strike> I converted the example code to process a series of ints and predict next int in series instead.

<strike>RNN-RBM to model and sequence music</strike> ( I changed this to handle chars from reading in plain text )


<b>Not in the book:</b>

<strike>Deep Reinforcement Learning</strike> (WIP, the Theano code needs streamlining but it works)
